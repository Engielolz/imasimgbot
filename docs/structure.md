## idols.txt

List of idols that should post. Must match directories in data/

## idol.txt

Contains configuration data. Has the birthday, image override information, the size of the global recents queue and the post interval.

## recents.txt

This is the global (for the idol) recents queue. Instead of resetting when its full, it instead rotates a list of the most recently used images (24 by default, but can be configured in idol.txt)

## \<event\>-recents.txt

Contains list of all used image entries. Cleared when all images have been used, to start the cycle anew.

## \<event\>.txt

Event files like regular.txt just contain a list of directory entries that contain the images and metadata relevant to the event.

## image.\<imgtype\>

The image itself. \<imgtype\> is just the file extension. It must match the one specified in info.txt or it won't work.

## info.txt

This file is inside of every image entry, and contains important metadata, namely the imgtype, alt text and any other idols that are in the image. All but imgtype may be omitted, but I recommend you just leave them blank. Multiple idols may be specified in otheridols by separating them with commas without spaces.

### example

```
imgtype=png
alt=Haruka Amami, Chihaya Kisaragi and Miki Hoshii
otheridols=chihaya,miki
```
